# Diabetes Prediction App [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/arunnthevapalan/diabetes-prediction-app/app.py)
Streamlit Web App to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures. For a walkthrough of the entire process of building the machine learning web application, [have a look at the accompanying Medium article published in Towards AI.](https://pub.towardsai.net/how-i-build-machine-learning-apps-in-hours-a1b1eaa642ed)

## Data

The data for the following example is originally from the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/) and is [available on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) The data contains information on females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Since the data has been added to the `data/` directory, cloning this repository would suffice.
## Pre-requisites

The project was developed using Python 3.6.7 with the following packages.
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas-profiling(renamed as ydata_profiling)
- Joblib
- Streamlit

Installation with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
Open the terminal in your machine and run the following command to access the web application in your localhost.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Run on Docker
Alternatively, you can build the Docker container and access the application at `localhost:8051` on your browser.
```bash
docker build --tag app:1.0 .
docker run --publish 8051:8051 -it app:1.0
```
## Files
- diabetes_prediction_pipeline.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook with all the workings including pre-processing, modelling and inference.
- app.py : Streamlit App script
- requirements.txt : pre-requiste libraries for the project
- models/ : trained model files and scaler objects
- data/ : source data

## Summary
This repository acts as a guide to [this blog post] where I talk about how I use Streamlit to build Machine Learning Applications quickly. Here we use a real-world example of predicting if a patient has diabetes and build a machine learning model. A Streamlit App was then built using a step-by-step approach in this project.
